Meet **Ralph** - your AI-powered marketing assistant who can analyze customer behavior, create personalized marketing campaigns, and automate email communications.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Build an AI agent using **LangGraph** and **NVIDIA**
- Implement **human-in-the-loop** workflows for sensitive operations
- Create **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** for customer segmentation
- Design **personalized marketing campaigns** using AI
- Integrate **PostgreSQL** with AI agents for real-time data analysis
- Use **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for tool integration

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.13+** installed
- **PostgreSQL** database (we'll use Supabase)
- **NVIDIA API key**

## ⚡ Quick Start

Want to get started immediately? Here's the fastest path:

This project uses `uv` for dependency management. If you don't have `uv` installed, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/).

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd crm-agent
   uv sync  # Install dependencies
   ```
2. **For ralph activation**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   uv pip install -e .
   ```
3. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your NVIDIA API key and Supabase URI
   ```

4. **Setup database** (create free Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)):
   - Create a new Supabase project. Use the generate_password feature to generate a secure password, copy it into the .env file for use later.
   - Copy the connection string from the Supabase project settings and paste it into the .env file (you'll see a 'connect' button at the top of the dashboard), replacing the placeholder with the actual connection string.
   - Replace the password placeholder with the password you generated earlier.
   - Copy and paste the sql from `db/migration-create-tables.sql` into the Supabase SQL editor. This will automatically create all of the db tables for you.
   - Import each CSV file from the `data` directory into the corresponding table in Supabase.

5. **Verify and run**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && uv run python chat_local.py  # Start chatting with Ralph!
   ```

## 🎮 Running the Application

### Start the Chat Interface

```bash
cd frontend
uv run python chat_local.py
```
